# Learning Machine Learning

This github repository consists all of my learning in machine learning and data science.
All the source code are used free and open license, so then if there is a programmer wants to use my source code, feel free to use it and modify it.
For them who want to use or develope my code, please do not hesitate to contact me. I am also so delightful to get a feedback from every programmer who work on machine learning and data science to improve my knowledge practically on it.

Thank you very much
