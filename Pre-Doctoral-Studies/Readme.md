### Predoctoral Study
I attend pre-doctoral courses in electrical engineering department at Ondokuz Mayıs Üniversitesi
Courses I take: Machine learning (at statistic department), Machine Learning with Python, Pattern Recognition, and Radar Signal Processing.
In this pre-doctoral courses, I supervised by Assoc. Prof. Hulya Gokalp Clarke and I study a case in machine learning approach for heart failure.
This folder contains all of my learning during my pre-doctoral course, especially related to my case study as mentioned above.

Feel free to use my code because so far my codes are also from another sources like Kaggle, Youtube, Book, and so on.
If you have any question or want to give me a feedback related to my work, please do not hesitate to contact me through: qisthialhazmi@gmail.com

Here some explanation about the code:
1. pre-test-1: I performed test Decision tree and Random forest algorithm to create a model from the heart disease dataset (source: UCI). However, in this test, I only used blood pressure, cholesterol, and maximum heart rate as my model features to detect the heart disease value (true, false). Also, in this code, I performed cross validation to validate the model, and performed graphiz to print the trees (this one is really excited).
2. pre-test-2: This program is not that too much different than the first one, but in this program I use all the features to detect the heart disease.
3. pre-test-2-rf-par: In this program, I only use Random forest algorithm to create a model from the heart disease dataset (source: UCI). The differences that in this program, I tried to reduce each feature to see the differences of the output (my supervisor asked me to do this though).
