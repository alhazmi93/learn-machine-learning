### Predoctoral Study
I attend pre-doctoral courses in electrical engineering department at Ondokuz Mayıs Üniversitesi
Courses I take: Machine learning (at statistic department), Machine Learning with Python, Pattern Recognition, and Radar Signal Processing.
In this pre-doctoral courses, I supervised by Assoc. Prof. Hulya Gokalp Clarke and I study a case in machine learning approach for heart failure.
This folder contains all of my learning during my pre-doctoral course, especially related to my case study as mentioned above.

Feel free to use my code because so far my codes are also from another sources like Kaggle, Youtube, Book, and so on.
